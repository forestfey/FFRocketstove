## FFRocketstove  
  
  
Adds a rocketstove to Rimworld, which only uses little wood as fuel.  
The version for 0.16 requires Nandonalts "Camping Stuff" mod to run properly, but with the release of 1.0 the rocketstove is a standalone mod, which requires no other mods to run.  
Can be added to savegames, but removal is not recommended.
